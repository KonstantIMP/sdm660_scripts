# sdm660_scripts
My scripts collection for Nokia 7.1 ROMs and kernels building

## Kernel building
I made special script for kernel building. It will automaticly download tools and sources and build kernel. Then the script will make flashable .ZIPs for TWRP

### How to use
```sh
sudo python source/kernel_build.py
```
